It's a clever, quirky romantic comedy spiced up with lots of goofy humor and a splash of R-rated eroticism. Tuoma Inaba is your average country-boy loose in the big city. He arrives in Tokyo to take his college entrance exams, but Tuoma's not too bright and he fails them all. In short order our hero enrolls in a cram school, poses as a student at the prestigious Keio University in order to pursue one beautiful girl, and moves in with another--his cousin Urara who has a huge crush on him. Then things start to get complicated. This collector's edition contains all 12 episodes of Sakura Diaries. Because it is based on an uncensored version of the Japanese original, there are several differences between it and the earlier multivolume release on VHS and DVD. The plot remains essentially the same, but there's more nudity and newly translated subtitles, and there is no English dub. If you already own the earlier edition and don't care about a few extra seconds of skin, you probably don't need the collector's edition, but for completists and those new to Sakura Diaries, this is the definitive version. --Simon Leake   \n",
              "2  First things first: Yes, Thinking XXX features adult film stars. No, the HBO production is not a porno. Nor does it include any clips. The documentary instead offers an introduction to the biggest names in the business, like Gina Lynn and Lukas Ridgeston. For his book, XXX - 30 Porn-Star Portraits, celebrity photographer Timothy Greenfield-Saunders shot the stars both clothed and unclothed. In the film, they talk about their work while getting their hair and make-up done, posing for pictures, playing with their pets, etc. They're presented as real people rather than actors (which just may destroy the fantasy for some fans). In the print edition, 15 writers, including author Nancy Friday, musician Lou Reed, and filmmaker John Waters, contribute their thoughts on pornography. They also appear on screen (fully clothed, of course). Some are quite critical. The biggest revelation isn't the nude bodies, readily available via videos and calendars, but what they have to say. Unlike Star 80 or Inside Deep Throat, there are no horror stories about physical or verbal abuse, but the talk is still frank and uncensored. Sean Michaels, for instance, opens up about race, while Chad Hunt discusses homosexuality. Interestingly, cover model Jenna Jameson doesnt utter a single word, possibly because she has already told her life story in the bestselling autobiography How to Make Love Like a Porn Star. --Kathleen C. Fennessy\\tAward-winning director and art photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders brings viewers onto the set of his newest photo shoot and into the private worlds of the top porn stars in the country in this unusual and provocative documentary. From Savanna Samson to Nina Hartley, Sean Michaels to Lukas Ridgeston straight to gay, legends to newcomers. Thinking XXX offers a clothed and unclothed look at some of America's legendary porn stars as they pose in front of Greenfield-Sanders's large-format portrait camera, and then discuss many of the facets of their lives and careers.

It's a clever, quirky romantic comedy spiced up with lots of goofy humor and a splash of R-rated eroticism. Tuoma Inaba is your average country-boy loose in the big city. He arrives in Tokyo to take his college entrance exams, but Tuoma's not too bright and he fails them all. In short order our hero enrolls in a cram school, poses as a student at the prestigious Keio University in order to pursue one beautiful girl, and moves in with another--his cousin Urara who has a huge crush on him. Then things start to get complicated. This collector's edition contains all 12 episodes of Sakura Diaries. Because it is based on an uncensored version of the Japanese original, there are several differences between it and the earlier multivolume release on VHS and DVD. The plot remains essentially the same, but there's more nudity and newly translated subtitles, and there is no English dub. If you already own the earlier edition and don't care about a few extra seconds of skin, you probably don't need the collector's edition, but for completists and those new to Sakura Diaries, this is the definitive version. --Simon Leake</td>\n",

The documentary instead offers an introduction to the biggest names in the business, like Gina Lynn and Lukas Ridgeston. For his book, XXX - 30 Porn-Star Portraits, celebrity photographer Timothy Greenfield-Saunders shot the stars both clothed and unclothed. In the film, they talk about their work while getting their hair and make-up done, posing for pictures, playing with their pets, etc. They're presented as real people rather than actors (which just may destroy the fantasy for some fans). In the print edition, 15 writers, including author Nancy Friday, musician Lou Reed, and filmmaker John Waters, contribute their thoughts on pornography. They also appear on screen (fully clothed, of course). Some are quite critical. The biggest revelation isn't the nude bodies, readily available via videos and calendars, but what they have to say. Unlike Star 80 or Inside Deep Throat, there are no horror stories about physical or verbal abuse, but the talk is still frank and uncensored. Sean Michaels, for instance, opens up about race, while Chad Hunt discusses homosexuality. Interestingly, cover model Jenna Jameson doesnt utter a single word, possibly because she has already told her life story in the bestselling autobiography How to Make Love Like a Porn Star. --Kathleen C. Fennessy\\tAward-winning director and art photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders brings viewers onto the set of his newest photo shoot and into the private worlds of the top porn stars in the country in this unusual and provocative documentary. From Savanna Samson to Nina Hartley, Sean Michaels to Lukas Ridgeston straight to gay, legends to newcomers. Thinking XXX offers a clothed and unclothed look at some of America's legendary porn stars as they pose in front of Greenfield-Sanders's large-format portrait camera, and then discuss many of the facets of their lives and careers. The film follows these women and men through interviews on and off of Greenfield-Sanders photo sets in New York and LA, delving into discussions of exhibitionism, private and public sex, money, and the business today.

They are available in a variety of head styles and materials.Alloy Steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties.  Steels are designated by a 4 number SAE Steel grade.  The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel.  The last 2 digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths).  Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials.  Flat head fasteners are designed to fit flush to the surface when used with countersunk holes.  Length is measured from the top of the head.  Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.  Coarse threading also allows for thicker coatings and platings.   \n",
              "1         This O-ring is made of black Buna-nitrile, is round in cross-section, has a durometer of 70A, and is designed for use in a wide variety of sealing applications.    Buna-nitrile can have high tensile strength, and abrasion, tear, and compression set resistance. It can be used in temperatures between -30 degrees F (-34 degrees C) to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C), and is compatible for use with petroleum, HFA, HFB and HFC fluids, vegetable oil, alcohol, acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Buna-nitrile is vulnerable to acetone, ethers, esters, ozone, sunlight and weathering and should therefore not be used in ozone-generating electric motors, welding equipment, or in applications with exposure to UV light.   This Buna O-ring has a shore durometer of 70A. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation.   O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves, and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section, and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in various sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter.   These Buna-nitrile O-rings meet standards defined by Aerospace Standard AS568A, which is the Aerospace Size Standard for O-rings.   \n",

They are available in a variety of head styles and materials.Alloy Steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties.  Steels are designated by a 4 number SAE Steel grade.  The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel.  The last 2 digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths).  Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials.  Flat head fasteners are designed to fit flush to the surface when used with countersunk holes.  Length is measured from the top of the head.  Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.  Coarse threading also allows for thicker coatings and platings.</td>\n",

Buna-nitrile can have high tensile strength, and abrasion, tear, and compression set resistance. It can be used in temperatures between -30 degrees F (-34 degrees C) to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C), and is compatible for use with petroleum, HFA, HFB and HFC fluids, vegetable oil, alcohol, acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Buna-nitrile is vulnerable to acetone, ethers, esters, ozone, sunlight and weathering and should therefore not be used in ozone-generating electric motors, welding equipment, or in applications with exposure to UV light.   This Buna O-ring has a shore durometer of 70A. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation.   O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves, and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section, and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in various sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter.
